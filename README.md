This projcet was pre-assignment 2022 for Vincit. I just wanted to try to do it.

THIS IS STILL WIP!!!

I watched RoadsideCoder and BrianDesign tutorials from Youtube to learn techniques.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.
